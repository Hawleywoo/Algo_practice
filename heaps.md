Heaps are another category of tree
many types of heaps
Similar to binary search tree but with different rules 

MaxBinaryHeap parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
    each parent has at most two child nodes
    value of each parent node is always greater than child
    there are no guarantess siblings are greater or lesser
    binary heaps are compact as possible all the children of each node are full
    as they can be and left children are filled first

MinBinaryHeap parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
    same as max but opposite  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a Priority Queue which are common very sed data structures

they are used quite a bit with graph traversal algo
